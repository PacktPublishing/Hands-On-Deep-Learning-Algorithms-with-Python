## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders.

The code will look like the following:
```
J_plus = forward_prop(x, weights_plus)
J_minus = forward_prop(x, weights_minus)
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
If you are a machine learning engineer, data scientist, AI developer, or simply want to focus on neural networks and deep learning, this book is for you. Those who are completely new to deep learning, but have some experience in machine learning and Python programming, will also find the book very helpful.

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book (Chapter 1-10).
